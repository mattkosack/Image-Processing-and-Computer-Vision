# Image-Processing-and-Computer-Vision
Repo for me to mess around with several textbook examples and other things. I just think CV is neat.

## Books I intend to use

### More Image Processing Focused

* A Computational Introduction to Digital Image Processing (2nd Ed) - McAndrew
* Digital Image Processing - Gonzalez and Woods
* Image Processing: The Fundamentals - Petrou and Petrou
* An Interdisciplinary Introduction to Image Processing: Pixels, Numbers, and Programs - Tanimoto

### More Computer Vision Focused
